# HotSport
A group project I worked on for my Human Computer Interaction elective in my 7th semester.
We decided to design a one stop destination for all sport lovers, where they can access news, updates and watch the live stream of any sport of their choice.
We conducted user research on the target audience which was our peers, they're main points were taken into account and so was their feedback on what they would like on the website.
An Empathy Map was created to make sure all the users points were taken into considerations while designing the final product.
A LoFi Prototype was drafted on and a few changes were made.
Finally a Hifi Prototype was designed using Adobe XD.
Heuristic Evaluation was performed on our final prototype.
We presented the flow of our Hifi prototype using the Desktop Preview function of Adobe XD.
